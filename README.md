# 🧠 Blockchain Simulations (Tampering, Mining, and Consensus)

This repository contains 3 educational blockchain simulations written in Node.js:

- 🔗 Blockchain Tampering Detection  
- ⛏️ Proof-of-Work Mining  
- 🧠 Consensus Mechanism Comparison  

---

## 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadanandkaji/blockseblock_task1.git
cd blockseblock_task1
````

## 1. 🔗 Blockchain Tampering Detection

Simulates a simple 3-block chain. Tampering with one block shows how hashes break and integrity fails.

### 🔧 Run:

```bash
node blockchain_simulation.js
```

---

## 2. ⛏️ Proof-of-Work Mining

Mines a block using a difficulty target (e.g., hash must start with `"0000"`). Shows nonce attempts and mining time.

### 🔧 Run:

```bash
node mining_simulation.js
```

---

## 3. 🧠 Consensus Mechanism Comparison

Simulates validator selection for:

* **PoW**: Highest power
* **PoS**: Highest stake
* **DPoS**: Most community votes

### 🔧 Run:

```bash
node consensus_demo.js
```

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Node.js ≥ v14
* Terminal or Command Line Interface

---

## 🧪 Great For

* Understanding immutability and hash chains
* Experiencing mining difficulty and nonce calculations
* Comparing consensus methods in blockchain
